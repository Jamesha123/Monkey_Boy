A 2D Adventure Game Demo

Files got deleted. That's what I get for trying to use AI to create a jar executable quick. 
Tried to decompile from the jar file and get source files back. That is why it looks funky. 
It is a demo game but it took me months of work to do though. 
Maybe I will try to fix when I have time. Jar executable of the game works fine.
